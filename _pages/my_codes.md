## MC/DC
Monte Carlo Dynamic Code is portable and exa-scale capable Monte Carlo neutron transport application written entirely in Python for rapid numerical methods exploration at scale. I am a maintainer and developer of numerical methods and the JIT compilation structures in MC/DC

## Therefore
Therefore is a collection of 1D deterministic S$$_N$$ radiation transport codes where I experiment with parallel algorithms, preconditioners, time stepping schemes, GPU software design and other numerical experiments. It's pretty messy but its all there!

## MC/DC TNT
MC/DC-Toy Neuronic test bed was a test bed code to experiment with various Python abstraction and acceleration packages including PyKokkos, PyCUDA/PyOpenCL, and Numba. This was the initial proof of concept for what would ultimately become MC/DC
